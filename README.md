Welcome to the Coffee Store Sales Analysis Project, where we delve into the heart of our business data to uncover insights that drive growth and efficiency. In this project, we harness the power of Excel to analyze sales data from our coffee shop, utilizing pivot tables and dashboards to transform raw numbers into actionable intelligence.

Our journey begins with meticulous data collection, where every transaction is recorded with precision, capturing essential details such as date, time, products sold, and sales amounts. We merge this data seamlessly with product information, enriching our analysis with insights into product performance and profitability.
